# kernel

The kernel needs to be compiled after applying the shambles.patch (or the experimental refactored.patch).

# jemalloc

Follow the INSTALL.md in the jemalloc directory.
Alternatively, extras/shambles.eb can be used, in order to install with easybuild.

# plugins

They can be simply compiled with gcc or clang.
